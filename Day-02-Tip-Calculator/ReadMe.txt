🛠 Project 2: Tip Calculator
Focus: Type Casting & Floating-Point Arithmetic.

💰 Tip Calculator
A precision-focused financial utility designed to handle arithmetic
operations and data type conversions.

Technical Highlight: Manages strict type casting between string,
float, and int to ensure mathematical integrity during user input ingestion.

Precision Engineering: Utilizes the round() function to ensure 
financial outputs adhere to a 2-decimal currency standard.

Clean Code: Uses f-strings for efficient and readable string interpolation 
of calculated results.
