🛠 Project 1: Band Name Generator
Focus: Input-Processing-Output (IPO) Patterns & String Handling.

🎸 Band Name Generator
A streamlined CLI utility demonstrating core Python data ingestion 
and string manipulation patterns.

Logic Pattern: Implemented a non-blocking linear data flow: 
Input ➔ String Concatenation ➔ Standard Output.

Engineering Highlight: Leveraged newline escape sequences (\n)
to optimize terminal UX and readability.

Scalability Path: Proposed addition of a Regex-based sanitization
layer to filter numerical or symbolic noise from user inputs.
