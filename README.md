🐍 100 Days of Python: Engineering Portfolio
This repository tracks my progress through Dr. Angela Yu’s "100 Days
of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp." 
My goal is to transform from writing basic scripts to architecting professional-grade 
software through daily, project-based output.

🏗 Engineering Pillars & Core Competencies
Rather than just learning syntax, I am focusing on mastering the following engineering 
domains:

UX Design & IPO Patterns: Optimizing CLI/GUI interfaces and streamlining the 
Input-Processing-Output flow.
•Arithmetic Integrity: Managing strict type casting and floating-point precision 
for financial and data-driven utilities.
•Decision Trees: Architecting complex nested conditional logic and multi-path control flow.
•Modularization: Decoupling visual assets and external dependencies from core logic 
to improve maintainability.
•Cryptographic Logic: Implementing randomized selection algorithms and modular arithmetic 
for secure data transformation.
•State Management: Tracking system status through iterative loops and boolean flags to 
manage complex program lifecycles.

🎓 Skills I am Acquiring
Upon completion of this 100-project journey, I will have attained professional fluency in:
•Core Development: OOP (Object-Oriented Programming), Functional Programming, and Error/Exception Handling.
•Web Development: Backend engineering with Flask and REST APIs, paired with frontend basics (HTML/CSS/Bootstrap).
•Data Science: Data manipulation and visualization using Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
•Automation: Web scraping with BeautifulSoup and Selenium, as well as automating local file systems and email.
•GUI Development: Building desktop applications using Tkinter and Turtle.
•Database Management: Designing and querying databases using SQL (SQLite/PostgreSQL).
