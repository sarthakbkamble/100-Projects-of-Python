🛠 Project 3: Treasure Island
Focus: Conditional Logic & Control Flow Trees.

🏝 Treasure Island
A narrative-driven CLI game engine built on complex nested 
conditional logic and control flow.

Architecture: Implemented a deep decision tree using nested 
if/elif/else statements to manage multiple game states and "Game Over" triggers.

Data Normalization: Utilizes .lower() method on user inputs to 
ensure case-insensitive string matching and reduce runtime errors.

Visual Assets: Incorporates multi-line ASCII art to enhance the 
command-line interface experience.
